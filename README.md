### Hello, I'm [ADARSH KAKATKAR] üëã

I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. Here's a glimpse of my work:

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects
- ** Tourism Problem Solution**:
- # Overview
This project addresses common challenges in the tourism industry by implementing a **Booking System**, **Recommendation Model**, and **Guidance System**. The solution is built using **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** to ensure optimal performance.

---

# Features

### 1. Booking System
- **Chain Hashing** is used for efficient storage and retrieval of bookings.
- Fast conflict resolution and seamless data management.

### 2. Recommendation Model
- **Graph Algorithms** (e.g., Dijkstra's or A*) recommend optimal travel routes and destinations.
- **KMP Algorithm** is implemented to match user preferences with destination features.

### 3. Guidance System
- **Shortest Path Algorithms** are used for in-trip navigation and assistance.
- Multi-criteria decision-making is integrated using optimization techniques.

---

## Technical Stack
- **Language:** C++/Java
- **Algorithms:** Chain Hashing, KMP, Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's, A*)
- **Tools:** Data structures (hash tables, graphs), algorithmic optimizations

---

## Impact
- **Efficiency:** Provides fast and accurate booking management.
- **Personalization:** Recommends destinations tailored to user preferences.
- **Navigation:** Offers reliable guidance and optimal route suggestions.
